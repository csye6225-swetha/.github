## Repositories for Assignment Work by Swetha Paturu for CSYE6225 ☁️

🌟 In these repositories, you'll find all my assignments from Northeastern University's CSYE6225 Network Structures and Cloud Computing course. This course significantly deepened my interest in cloud computing and broadened my exposure to a variety of AWS services. I extend my special thanks to Prof. Tejas Parikh for his insightful and challenging assignments 


### 🚀 Project Overview 

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of cloud application development and deployment, emphasizing robust security and high availability: 

- RESTful Application Development & Enhanced CI:
     - Developed a scalable RESTful application, with Continuous Integration via GitHub Actions ensuring code reliability and quality.
     - Integrated detailed logging and metrics for effective monitoring and performance analysis.
       
- Application Scaling and Event-Driven Architecture:
     - Implemented AutoScaling for dynamic capacity management.
     - Used Amazon SNS for an efficient, event-driven architecture.
       
- AMI Creation and Userdata Scripting:
     - Customized Amazon Machine Images (AMI) for a consistent deployment environment.
     - Leveraged userdata scripts for automated instance configuration.
       
- Robust Infrastructure Deployment with Security:
     - Deployed a secure AWS infrastructure, with a focus on network and resource isolation.
     - Utilized IAM roles and security groups to enforce strict access controls and security best practices.
     - Configured the Application Load Balancer to only accept HTTPS requests, enhancing data security in transit, with SSL/TLS certificates managed through AWS Certificate
       Manager (ACM).
     - Employed Route 53 for reliable domain registration and DNS management.
       
- Lambda Functions for Automated Operations:
     - Integrated AWS Lambda for automated responses to specific events, streamlining operations and increasing efficiency.
